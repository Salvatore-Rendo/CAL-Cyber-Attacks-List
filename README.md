## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installing


```
git clone https://github.com/Salvatore-Rendo/CAL-Cyber-Attacks-List
```

```
cd CAL-Cyber-Attacks-List
```

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Change directory inside the projects to chose the attack you want to use:

```
cd Attack-you-chose
```

Then run the helper to get a better understanding of the attack

```
attack-you-chose.py -h
```

If the attack requires a target ip, you can easily create a dummy server with python:

```
python3 -m http.server [port to listen eg.4343]
```
Or with netcat:
```
nc -lk [port to listen eg.4343]
```

And use it to be the target of your attacks.
